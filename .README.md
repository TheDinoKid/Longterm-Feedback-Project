# Longterm-Feedback-Project
Longterm feedback project created for Doctor Brian Wargo in May of 2021  

The point of this project was to make it far easier to not only create easy way to get anonymous feedback, but also to make easy use for other students and even other schools if the project went well. That is also why I am making this github page, to hope that years after I personally am working on it, or even while I still am that students from my own school or maybe even others can work on this and improve it.
